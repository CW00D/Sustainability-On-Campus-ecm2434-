            An anagram puzzle is released everyday, solve it to reveal a hint for that day's miniboss' location<br><br>

            Explore around campus while checking the map to find the miniboss' location. Once you are in the correct 
            location a button will appear and you will be able to battle the boss<br><br>

            Pay attention to what they are saying, as at the end of the week  you may fight
            a megaboss where your knowledge of the sustainability issues discussed will be tested<br><br>

            Have fun!
